## 🎯 INVESTOR PITCH

"Companies spend millions on compliance training but have no idea if employees actually understand their policies. They just know if they clicked through the PDF."

### **Why It's Unique:**
1. **No competitor has comprehension tracking**
2. **Patent-pending technology**
3. **Data-driven document improvement**
4. **Screen sync for training built-in**

### **The Demo:**
1. Show reader with comprehension bar (30 sec)
2. Mark a few sections (30 sec)
3. Show dashboard with confusion hotspots (1 min)
4. Demo screen sync on two devices (1 min)
5. "This is the future of compliance training"
